Packet Tracer â€“ Home IoT Implementation
Scenario :-

In this Packet Tracer scenario, Bob has begun to implement an IoT solution in his home. You will explore the variety of devices and manipulate environmental factors to see the impact on sensors and actuators. You will also configure some basic settings, including IP addressing for a sensor, and security settings for the gateway router. Finally, you will verify that all the devices in the home have IP connectivity.
